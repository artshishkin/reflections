When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because somebody can work with the same files and commit change while i work with them. But I don't want files change during my work.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
branch is local
fork is in github
clone is a copy of your repository/ may be local or from github to your computer

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
i don't understand
