How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I was developing programs for different control systems. Every time I made some serious modification of code I saved current source code. And many many many times i was looking for my bugs by viewing difference between files. Very often I used Total Commander for this (it has an oppotunity for comparing 2 files).

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Easy access will help quickly find changes and I can remember what I did.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros
You can decide when to commit manually.
Cons
You may forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It's very important because files may be very interconnected

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log - to view versions
git diff - to find difference

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can alway checkout and undo changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For commit my own source code
